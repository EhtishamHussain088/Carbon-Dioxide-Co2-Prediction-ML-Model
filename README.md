Carbon Dioxide Co2 Prediction Model Using ML
The regression model I employed for predicting CO2 emissions was designed to analyze and forecast emissions generated by the oil and gas industry, specifically focusing on power generation. The model utilized historical data comprising variables such as energy production levels, fuel consumption, operational efficiency, and CO2 intensity. After preprocessing the dataset, I explored several regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regressor, to identify the most effective approach for this task.

To enhance the accuracy, I incorporated feature engineering by selecting highly correlated variables through statistical measures such as Pearson correlation coefficients. I also addressed multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and scaled the data to ensure uniformity. For model optimization, I used GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters, ensuring the best performance.

The final model was trained on an 80-20 train-test split, achieving a high RÂ² score on the test dataset, reflecting its predictive strength. I evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results demonstrated the model's ability to predict CO2 emissions accurately based on given input parameters.

This regression model aids in understanding emission trends and provides insights for reducing carbon footprints in power generation within the oil and gas sector.
